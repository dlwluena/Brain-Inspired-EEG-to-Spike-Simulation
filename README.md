# Brain-Inspired EEG-to-Spike Simulation

# Description

Inspired by biological neural systems, this project processes EEG signals into spike trains to realistically simulate neuron activity using the Brian2 framework.

---

# Project Aim

This project explores how brainwave data can be transformed into biologically meaningful spike representations and fed into a spiking neuron model. Using real EEG data, we simulate how a neuron reacts to different power levels in specific brainwave bands ‚Äî especially the alpha band ‚Äî by generating spike trains and observing firing behavior.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **EEG Data Loading**  
   Loads EEG signals from the MNE sample dataset.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Applies a band-pass filter (1‚Äì40 Hz) to remove noise and artifacts.

3. **Spectral Analysis (PSD)**  
   Calculates Power Spectral Density using Welch‚Äôs method, with a focus on the alpha band (8‚Äì13 Hz).

4. **Spike Encoding**  
   Normalized alpha power is converted into a rate-based binary spike train.

5. **Neuron Simulation (Brian2)**  
   The spike train is fed into a simulated neuron built using Brian2. The neuron integrates input and fires (spikes) if its membrane potential exceeds a threshold.

6. **Visualization**  
   Plots the generated spike train and visualizes neuron firing events across a 100ms time window.

**What Is This Project About?**

Have you ever wondered how your brain talks to itself?

Inside your brain, tiny cells called neurons send electric signals to one another ‚Äî kind of like text messages made out of electricity. Scientists can record those signals using a device called an EEG (Electroencephalogram), which listens to your brain from the outside of your head.

These brain signals look like messy, wavy lines. But behind those waves is useful information ‚Äî like how focused you are, or whether you're relaxed or alert.

In this project, we:

1. Take real brain signals (EEG data).
2. Clean them up (remove noise and useless info).
3. Measure how strong certain brainwaves are (especially something called alpha waves).
4. Turn those strengths into digital pulses ‚Äî short ‚Äúspikes‚Äù of activity, like a Morse code your brain might use.
5. Feed those spikes into a digital neuron ‚Äî a tiny computer model that acts like a real brain cell.
6. Watch what happens ‚Äî does it fire? How often?

So basically:
+ We‚Äôre turning brain signals into computer pulses and using them to make a digital brain cell respond ‚Äî just like a real one would.
It‚Äôs a mix of brain science and computer simulation. Even though it sounds complex, this project is built to show the basic idea in a simple and visual way.
